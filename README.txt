Project description
What I built was a simple ice cream ordering app. The idea behind the app was to gain further practice with simple HTML, CSS styling and Javascript, in particular DOM manipulation. A user can type into the input fields their desired order. Once they have completed the form, they hit submit and their order is displayed back to them. 
To start over, a user must simply refresh the page.
